TO ANSWER:
1. Add your response under the question's "Your answer:" line.
2. Change [PENDING] to [ANSWERED].
3. Save the file. Locally that's enough; in sync mode (ORCH_SYNC=1) you can
   do both steps in the GitHub web editor and commit — the loop pulls before
   every iteration.

No restart needed. The next iteration picks the answer up — typically within
a couple of minutes (the loop slows to 5-minute checks when fully idle). The
orchestrator records the resolution in DECISIONS.md and moves the entry to

### [ANSWERED] Worker auth broken — no API credentials in the container

Every worker spawn failed with `authentication_failed` ("Not logged in", `apiKeySource: none`): no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment, no credentials file, and child `claude -p` processes inherit nothing from the orchestrator session.

**Your answer:** Resolved by action rather than text: commit ac95f66 ("Load credentials from container env file for worker agents") makes `bin/spawn` source `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` (which provides `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) inside each worker script. Orchestrator verified on 2026-06-10: `claude -p` with that env file loaded authenticates and responds. Worker spawning is unblocked.
